# endamccormack-site

## Overview
For the longest time I wanted to have a personal website again after my â‚¬'s dried up in University meaning I had to give up my hosting. Recently I went back to see if it still worked and it does, quite good for 2nd year in university but... fatal flaw, built in ASP.NET. 

I learned a lot from that first website, the site took too much maintainence, it was a lot more than it needed to be. Built in a waterfall "ALL THE FEATURES" mentality, too many "nice to have's". For this project I am going to be building it with a mixture between agile and lean. Lots of experimentation and only working on what I need. 

## My user stories
1. As a developer/devops I want to be able to blog so I have notes to benefit both me and others in the future.
2. As a human I am inherantly lazy so I would like this to require no effort to maintain/update.
3. As a developer who loves design I would loke to have a beautiful site to be proud of.

## My Solution
Design pattern: Google's Material Design
Frontend: AngularJS (because i've been wanting to do a project in it for a while)
Backend: Github API and markdown pages
